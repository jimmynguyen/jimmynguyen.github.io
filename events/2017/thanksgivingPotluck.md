I just want to get a head count of who plans on going (you're welcome to bring guests. just let me know first).

There are two tabs on the sheet. The second tab is if you know what you plan on bringing. This is pretty self explanatory so I don't think I need to say much more...

I'll provide all the plates/cups/utensils. Let me know what you would like to drink and I'll see if I can make it happen. If not and you're adamant about what you're drinking, you're welcome to bring it
